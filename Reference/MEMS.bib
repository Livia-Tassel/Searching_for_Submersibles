  abstract  = {In order to ensure the long-term safe and continuous operation of the submersible, accurate depth measurement is one of the necessary conditions. This paper presents an integrated depthometer detection system based on MEMS microelectronics technology, which monitors sea water temperature, salinity, density, submersible pitch and roll attitudes, and other parameters related to depth. A multi-sensor fusion processing and compensation mechanism is constructed to improve the overall detection accuracy of the depthometer system and meet the safety requirements for long-duration submersible operation.},
